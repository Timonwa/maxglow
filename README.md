### A company profile website.
This is a static 4 page website made for a client to showcase their different businesses.
The first page which is the main/home page shows the main company details and has links to the other 3 companies or sub companies/business runned by the owner.
The other 3 pages all contain details also of the individual sub companies including a picture gallery and a section that shows the members of the company/business.

So we have:
- the main company page,
- a magazine publishing company page,
- an NGO page and
- a jewelry store page.

The jewelry store has links that takes the potential buyer to the owner's WhatsApp account or Instagram page.

The menu bar is a CSS dropdown hover menu.

Here is the [deployed link](https://website-for-princess.vercel.app/index.html).
